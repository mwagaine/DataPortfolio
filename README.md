# DataPortfolio

Here, you can find a selection of projects I have been working on since I've started retraining as a data scientist. 


## Python projects

<ins>Regression Modelling: Airbnb Prices</ins>
<br>
The aim of this project was to both predict the price of Airbnb listings in inner London using regression algorithms, and also gauge what factors contribute to their prices. 

<ins>Classification Modelling: Songs</ins>
<br>
For this project, I was given just a day to explore a music dataset, using supervised and unsuperivsed classification models to see if I could either predict the class of a song or if I could group songs together and determine what brought them together in the first place. 

<ins>Web Scraping: UK Number 1 Singles of 1999</ins>
<br>
In this project, I scraped data from Wikipedia to produce a table of all the weeks. included the name of artist, song and the sales the song accumulated that week in order to reach the summit.


## SQL projects

<ins>Data Cleaning: Housing in Nashville</ins>

<ins>Data Exploration: Covid-19</ins>
