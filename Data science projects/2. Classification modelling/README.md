# Project overview

## Description 

In the middle of my 12-week training programme at Digital Futures, I was set a task that simulated a day in the office after a big project had finished. I was given just a day to explore a dataset, the objective being to see if I could gain any interesting insights and, with the help of supervised and unsupervised classification models, spot any patterns.

I picked a dataset containing information about songs such as their genre, tempo, danceability and popularity. For supervised learning, I used the K-nearest neighbours model to predict the genre of songs, whilst for unsupervised learning I used the K-means clustering model to see if I could spot any significant groups of datapoints based on common features.

## Prerequisites

For this project, you will need to download the two datasets available in the Data folder and an IDE (integrated learning environment) that runs on Python such as <a href='https://noteable.io/jupyter-notebook/install-jupyter-notebook/'>Jupyter Notebook</a>. Google Colab is an option you can use without having to install Python manually, however, you might have to install some of the packages used in this project. A guide of how to do this can be found <a href='https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-install-python-packages-in-googles-colab/#:~:text=With%20Colab%2C%20you%20can%20run,how%20to%20install%20Python%20packages.'>here</a>.
