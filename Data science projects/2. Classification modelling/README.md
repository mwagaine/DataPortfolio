# Classification modelling with music data


## Description 

In the middle of my 12-week training programme at Digital Futures, I was set a task that simulated a day in the office after a big project had finished. I was given just a day to explore a dataset, the objective being to see if I could gain any interesting insights and, with the help supervised and unsupervised classification models, spot any patterns.

I picked a dataset containing information about songs such as their genre, tempo, danceability and their popularity. For supervised learning, I used the K-nearest neighbours model to predict the genre of songs, whilst for unsupervised learning I used the K-means clustering model to see if I could spot any significant groups of datapoints based on common features. 


## Prerequisites

For this project, all you will need is. Google Colab is another you can use without having to install and download Python manually, however, you must make sure that any of the.
