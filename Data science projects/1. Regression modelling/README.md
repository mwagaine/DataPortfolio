# Regression modelling with Airbnb prices


## Description 

At the end of my 12-week training programme at Digital Futures, I embarked on this capstone project to round-off what I had learned so far.

I picked a machine learning project that could help solve a problem that affects many of us today - the housing crisis. Using regression models such as linear regression and decision trees, I wanted to find the best model that accurately predict the price of Airbnb listings in London based on 2019 data. contribute would attempt to solve, I decided. 

The aim of this project to find a regression model that can accurately predict the price of Airbnb listings in inner London. By knowing what factors (features) most influence these predictions, we can then deduce what. Why is this important? The housing crisis. 

The data for this project was downloaded.


## Prerequisites

For this project, all you will need is. Google Colab is another you can use without having to install and download Python manually, however, you must make sure that any of the.
