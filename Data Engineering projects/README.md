In this project, I extracted music sales data from the web and transformed it, before loading it into a PostgreSQL database and exploring the data with queries. 


<ins>CDC pipeline</ins>

With the same data from the ETL pipeline, I loaded the data from the PostgreSQL database to a new MySQL database and replicated any data changes made at the source in the target.
